# StealHouse Frontend Plan

## Current Status

The frontend is in the early planning stages. The project has been initialized with React + Vite and will be developed to display property data from the database.

## Planned Architecture

    A[React App] --> B[React Router]
    B --> C[Property List Page]
    B --> D[Property Detail Page]
    B --> E[User Dashboard]
    B --> F[Preferences Page]
    
    C --> G[API Service]
    D --> G
    E --> G
    F --> G
    
    G --> H[Backend API]
```

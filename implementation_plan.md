# Step 5: Database Migration (COMPLETED)

## Objective
Create and validate a database migration that combines the existing tables into a single `houses` table, preserving important data while dropping unused columns and tables.

## Tasks

*   **Generate Migration Script:**
    *   ‚úÖ Run `alembic revision --autogenerate -m "Merge gallery_houses and detail_houses into houses table, remove floor_plans"` in the terminal within the project environment.
*   **Review and Edit Script (`database_migrations/versions/<script_name>.py`):**
    *   ‚úÖ **Carefully inspect** the auto-generated `upgrade()` function:
        *   ‚úÖ Verify it drops the `floor_plans` table.
        *   ‚úÖ Verify it adds necessary columns to one of the existing tables (e.g., `gallery_houses`) or creates the new `houses` table.
        *   ‚úÖ **Crucially, ensure it includes data migration logic:** Add SQL operations (e.g., using `op.execute()`) to copy relevant data from `detail_houses` into the columns added to `gallery_houses` (or into the new `houses` table) before dropping `detail_houses`. Use appropriate JOINs or UPDATE statements based on a common identifier (like `vesteda_id`).
        *   ‚úÖ Verify it drops the now-redundant columns (`image_url`, `complex_image_url`, `read_more_url`).
        *   ‚úÖ Verify it drops the `detail_houses` table.
        *   ‚úÖ Verify it renames the modified table (e.g., `gallery_houses`) to `houses` using `op.rename_table()`.
    *   ‚úÖ Review the `downgrade()` function:
        *   ‚úÖ Ensure it correctly reverses the schema changes (recreates tables/columns).
        *   ‚úÖ Data restoration during downgrade is optional but schema restoration is important.
*   **Test Migration Locally:**
    *   ‚úÖ Create a backup of your development database if needed.
    *   ‚úÖ Run `alembic upgrade head` to apply the migration.
    *   ‚úÖ Verify the database schema has been updated as expected.

## Expected Outcomes
- ‚úÖ A thoroughly reviewed migration script that properly:
  - ‚úÖ Creates the new unified houses table
  - ‚úÖ Migrates existing data from the old tables
  - ‚úÖ Removes redundant columns and tables
- ‚úÖ Successfully applied migration with all schema changes in place
- ‚úÖ A properly implemented downgrade path to restore the original schema if needed 

# Step 6: Documentation Update (IN PROGRESS)

## Objective
Update all project documentation to reflect the new unified database model and reorganized script structure.

## Tasks

*   **Architecture Documentation (`docs/architecture.md`):**
    *   ‚úÖ Update the Database Schema section to show only the `houses` table and its columns.
    *   ‚úÖ Remove mentions of `gallery_houses`, `detail_houses`, and `floor_plans` tables.
    *   ‚úÖ Update Data Models section to describe only the `House` Pydantic model and `DbHouse` SQLAlchemy model.
    *   ‚úÖ Revise the Data Flow section/diagrams to illustrate the simplified, single-step scraping and storage process.
    *   ‚úÖ Update any architecture diagrams to reflect the new structure.
*   **Deployment Documentation (`docs/deployment.md`):**
    *   ‚úÖ Update any commands for building the Docker image or running scripts to use the new paths under the `scripts/` directory.
    *   ‚úÖ Update any deployment instructions that might reference the old database structure.
    *   ‚úÖ Verify all script paths are correctly updated to the new locations.
*   **Cloud SQL Setup (`docs/cloud_sql_setup.md`):** 
    *   ‚úÖ Review for any references to the old database tables and update accordingly.
*   **Project README:**
    *   ‚úÖ Update any quick-start instructions to reflect the new script locations.
    *   ‚úÖ Update any database schema references if present.
*   **Other Documentation:**
    *   ‚è≥ Review any other documentation files for references to:
        *   The old database schema/tables
        *   Scripts in their previous locations
        *   The two-step crawling process

## Expected Outcomes
- ‚úÖ Updated documentation throughout the project that accurately reflects:
  - ‚úÖ The new unified database schema
  - ‚úÖ The simplified data collection approach
  - ‚úÖ The reorganized script locations
- ‚úÖ Revised architecture diagrams (if any) showing the streamlined process
- ‚úÖ Updated command examples for scripts that use the new paths 

# Step 7: Final Cleanup (NOT STARTED)

## Objective
Perform a thorough codebase cleanup to remove any remaining references to the old models, tables, and unused fields.

## Tasks

*   **Code Search and Removal:**
    *   ‚è≥ Perform a project-wide search for the following terms and remove/update any remaining usages:
        *   `GalleryHouse`, `DetailHouse`, `FloorPlan`
        *   `DbGalleryHouse`, `DbDetailHouse`, `DbFloorPlan`
        *   `image_url`, `complex_image_url`, `read_more_url` (in the context of removed fields)
        *   `gallery_houses`, `detail_houses`, `floor_plans` (in the context of table names)
    *   ‚è≥ Ensure these terms are only used in the migration script for backward compatibility.
*   **Remove Redundant Logic:**
    *   ‚è≥ Delete any helper functions or utility methods that were dedicated solely to:
        *   Converting between gallery/detail houses
        *   Handling floor plans
        *   Managing the two-step extraction process
    *   ‚è≥ Remove any now-unused imports throughout the codebase.
*   **Code Style and Documentation Consistency:**
    *   ‚è≥ Ensure any new or modified functions have proper type hints.
    *   ‚è≥ Add or update docstrings for any modified functions.
    *   ‚è≥ Verify that async function names have the `_async` suffix per project conventions.
*   **Linting and Static Analysis:**
    *   ‚è≥ Run any available linters or static analysis tools on the modified code.
    *   ‚è≥ Address any warnings or errors that may have been introduced.

## Expected Outcomes
- ‚è≥ Clean codebase with no lingering references to removed models/tables/fields
- ‚è≥ Removal of any redundant or obsolete code
- ‚è≥ Consistent style and documentation across all modified files
- ‚è≥ Codebase that passes all linting checks and static analysis
